    Welcome to the Star Wars Universe application. This application uses the Star Wars API (SWAPI) and the Faker gem to fetch and generate data about various elements in the Star Wars universe.

    <h2 class="h4 font-weight-bold mb-3">Data Integration and Associations</h2>
    <p class="mb-3">
      For the Star Wars website, I plan to utilize data from multiple sources provided by the Star Wars API (SWAPI). The data from SWAPI is structured as a collection of RESTful endpoints, each representing a specific category of Star Wars information such as planets, people, starships, vehicles, films, and species.
      To integrate these different datasets, I will establish relationships between the tables based on the associations mentioned below. Here's an overview of the data, associations, and the required database tables and columns we will utilize:
