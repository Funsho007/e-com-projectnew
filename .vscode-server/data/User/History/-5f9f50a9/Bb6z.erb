    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Data Integration and Associations</h2>
    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      For the Star Wars website, I plan to utilize data from multiple sources provided by the Star Wars API (SWAPI). The data from SWAPI is structured as a collection of RESTful endpoints, each representing a specific category of Star Wars information such as planets, people, starships, vehicles, films, and species.
      To integrate these different datasets, I will establish relationships between the tables based on the associations mentioned below. Here's an overview of the data, associations, and the required database tables and columns we will utilize:
