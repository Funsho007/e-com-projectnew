Using data from the city's open data set figure out how many of our trees may die now that the Emerald Ash Borer has been found here. In other words, how many Ash trees do we have in the city?

  A subset of tree dataset can be found here: https://data.winnipeg.ca/resource/d3jk-hb6j.json
  The full tree dataset can be found here: https://data.winnipeg.ca/resource/d3jk-hb6j.json?$limit=306000

  Using code similar to what was provided in question three, load up the tree JSON data and use JSON.parse to convert it to Ruby data. Investigate the data using the pretty print command and then write a program to automatically count all the Ash trees in the dataset. Remember that there are different types of ash trees.

  To speed up your investigation start using the first URL (the subset of tree data) and then when you get things working try switching to the full tree dataset.
